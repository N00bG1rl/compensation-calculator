The task took about 14 hours to complete. I got stuck with a few points and the homework was definitely more interesting than it seemed at first glance. I also feel that I would have finish it sooner, but as I had only few hours per day to spend on it, it was harder to get into right mindset. Anyways... Thanks for checking my homework!
